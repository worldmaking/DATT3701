# FA/DATT 3701 6.00 Collaborative Game Project

## Course Description

In this year long studio course the class collaborates on the realization of two or three ambitious game projects. Students will work together as a development team by taking on roles where they focus on specific aspects of the project (such as Director, Designer, Artist, Programmer, Level Designer, Sound Designer, Publicity, etc.) The development team structure is modeled on teams used in large-scale project development within fields related to games that rely on multi-stakeholder collaboration and interdisciplinary research. Projects may incorporate partnerships with York-based or external Faculties, Departments, or research teams depending on the focus of the project. The nature of the project themes will vary from year to year, but will be a significant work in the field of games. 

The course instructor(s) will prepare a general description of the project(s) at the beginning of the course. The details of the project(s) will be developed as part of the class activities. As part of the project development and execution students will be expected to prepare presentations, posters, and a written paper. The culmination of this course will be a final presentation in a public venue. In addition to group assignments, students are evaluated based on their individual contribution, teamwork, presentations, and other deliverables as appropriate. 

**Prerequisites:** Only open to students the Digital Media Specialized Honours BA program Games stream. FA/DATT 2300 3.0, FA/DATT 2301 3.0, LE/EECS 2030 3.0 Course credit exclusion: FA/DATT 3700 6.0

**Language of Instruction:** English

## Organization of the Course 

The first part of the course focuses on ideation toward proposal development, including rapid pitching, peer reviews, thematic lectures, tutorials, individual research and experimentation, establishing groups, critique and discussion, collaborative sketching, design document development, project management, alpha development, and internal and external review. We expect to approve two or three projects for production, by groups of between three and six members each. 

The second part of the course focuses on production, culminating in public dissemination, with team members taking on specific roles and responsibilities, supported by periodic demo and test, critique/review, and specialized technical tutorials. The final game must be presented in at least one public event prior to the end of the semester. 

Beside group work, throughout the course you will be asked to maintain a 'devblog' updated weekly, to submit a number of individual written assignments or questionnaires, and contribute generously to in-class discussions. Students must attend all class times, and should expect to spend an average of two to three hours per week on assignments and contributions to group work outside of class time.

Throughout the course, as instructors we will act primarily in two roles. First, we will act as the clients, perhaps akin to publishers or curators, of the projects: we issue the call, we articulate the requirements, and will play the principal role in selecting and refining the proposals and their subsequent production. Second, we will act as pedagogical and technical support: we will lead several guided tutorial sessions in the likely software platforms for projects, followed by focused lab guidance as the projects develop.

## Evaluation

The final grade for the course will be based on the following items weighted as indicated:

**Fall Semester**
- Short written assignments: 20% 
- Group proposals: 20% 
- Group prototypes & presentations: 40% 
- Role contribution: 20%

**Winter Semester**
- Role contribution: 30% 
- Reflective papers: 30% 
- Final project: 40%

**Grading**: The final grade is derived from the mean of the Fall and Winter grades. The grading scheme for the course conforms to the 9-point grading system used in undergraduate programs at York (e.g., A+ = 9, A = 8, B+ - 7, C+ = 5, etc.). Assignments and tests will bear either a letter grade designation or a corresponding number grade (e.g., A+ = 90 to 100, A = 80 to 90, B+ = 75 to 79, etc.)  For a full description of York grading system see the York University Undergraduate Calendar at [https://calendars.registrar.yorku.ca/2010-2011/academic/index.htm](https://calendars.registrar.yorku.ca/2010-2011/academic/index.htm).
**Assignment Submission:** Proper academic performance depends on students doing their work not only well, but on time. Accordingly, assignments for this course must be received on the due date specified for the assignment. ***All assignments must be submitted to complete the course.***

**Lateness Penalty:** Assignments received later than the due date will be penalized five grade points per day that assignment is late. Exceptions to the lateness penalty for valid reasons such as illness, compassionate grounds, etc., may be entertained by the Course Instructor but will require supporting documentation (e.g., a doctor’s letter).

## The call for work

We seek proposals for three new works in the area of computer video games, to be developed to a fully-realized play-tested state suitable for its presentation in a public venue, and dissemination online.

The first requirement: We are specifically seeking works that break central conventions of gaming, or address a paradoxical character of gaming media, in a clearly articulated way. 

The second requiremnt: Each project should further differentiate itself by integrate its theme centrally with at least one non-conventional or newly emerging interface format:

- Alternative controllers (alt.ctrl) including physical computing
- Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Display (probably limited to one team only)
- Augmented / Mixed Reality
- Some other alternative interface format, e.g. audio-driven gaming 

We will introduce and are happy to support mainstream gaming engines including Unreal and Unity, as well as less conventional platforms such as Max/MSP/Jitter, Cinder, JS/WebGL, Processing, Arduino, etc. 

## Rationale for the call

First: The computer/video games industry (AKA interactive entertainment industry) is 45 years old, and stratified. Many problems, crises. For example:

- **781 million** games on Steam
	- 37% of these have never been played
	- Nearly 40% uploaded in the last year
	- Steam abandoned control (Greenlight), replaced with curating program, but already curators of curators...
	- Vast majority are copycats, cheap spinoffs, generic and formulaic stereotypes
	- Investors averse to risky concepts with big budgets; low price points require quick turnaround; both lead to least common denominator
	- Also much easier to generate minor variants of a formula or template than to be genuinely original.

Nobody wants to see a portfolio of mediocrity. Away from the mainstream, there are more experimental corners of independent (and occasionally corporate) games demonstrating many refreshingly unusual approaches. Some of these have become so successful that they have launched entire new genres. Even those that don't attract a lot of attention. The most interesting innovators and movements in art (and elsewhere) are born from rejecting tradition.

Second: the experiences that work well on standard gaming platforms do not always translate well to alternate platforms and interfaces. What makes a new interface or format most interesting may also be how it confounds conventional gaming tropes. Like any new format, it is well worth stepping back from the contemporary world to see bigger pictures. What is the real message of the medium? What can it say that hasn't been said? 

But to stretch expectations or break conventions, we need to identify what they are. So perhaps to begin, ***what exactly is a game?***

<!--
In [Reality is Broken](https://janemcgonigal.com/my-book/) Jane McGonigal identifies  four defining traits within the vast diversity of games (both within & beyond the digital forms). Everything else McGonigal holds are there to enhance these four traits, including immersive graphics, that increase our ability to pay sustained attention:

- **goal(s):** outcomes to achieve, focusing attention and orienting partipation. Purpose.
- **rules:** limitations on how goals can be achieved. "Rules push players to explore previously uncharted possibility spaces. They unleash creativity and foster strategic thinking."
- **feedback system:** Tells players how close they are to achieving goals. Points, levels, scores, progress bars, "the game is over when...", etc. A promise of achievability, and a motivation to continue playing. Variety and intensity of feedback is what differentiates digital and non-digital games. You can feel how attentive the game is to you, and approach the very limits of flow).
- **voluntary participation:** All players knowingly and willingly accept the goal, rules, and feedback. A common ground for participation. Freedom to enter/leave establishes a safe and pleasurable activity.

Bernard Suits sums it up: **"Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles."**, which McGonigal paraphrases: "any well-designed game is an invitation to tackle an unnecessary obstacle". "Freedom to work in the most logical and efficient way is the very opposite of gameplay." For example, golf: choosing to make the work of getting a ball into a hole more difficult. Or Portal: the goal at first is to figure out what the goal is; like many games, some puzzles teach you a new capability (new rules).

Why do unnecessary obstacles make us happy? Hard work that we **choose** to do, with no real danger. The opposite of play isn't work, it's depression: pessimistic sense of inadequacy, despondent lack of activity, being forced into the wrong place. Gameplay gives an optimistic sense of capabilities, invigorating rush of activity, positive valence. Fiero: possibly the most primal emotional rush we can experience. Italian for pride, triumph over adversity. Play activates all neurological/physiological systems of happiness: attention systems, reward center, motivation systems, emotion & memory centers... in a way that passive low-engagement activities (tv, chocolate, window-shopping etc.) don't. Tal Ben-Shahar: **"we're much happier enlivening time rather than killing time."**

## Manifesto for a ludic century (Erik Zimmerman)

Erik Zimmerman's article [on Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/manifesto-the-21st-century-will-be-defined-by-games-1275355204), formed as a manifesto, argues for games as the defining medium of the current century:

> The last century's media was based on information communication: linear, often unidirectional; creating bureaucratic systems. This century's media is non-linear, systemic, modular, participatory, customizable, playful. Environmental: immersive, inhabitable, explorable. Complex systems thinking. 

> It is not enough to merely be a systems-literate person; to understand systems in an analytic sense. We also must learn to be playful in them. A playful system is a human system, a social system rife with contradictions and with possibility.

Ian Bogost's response: [Winning Isn't Everything](https://medium.com/matter/winning-isnt-everything-255b3a26d1cf):

>  "I used to think that games would be the dominant medium of the 21st century. The reality? They're too big, too complex, and too smart for that to be true."

## What is a notgame|nongame|ungame|anti-game?

> "One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might cite an immersive game without points or rules, but I would say then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can only experience them." [Roger Ebert, "Video games can never be art"](https://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art). *(Ebert later conceded that games may indeed be art in a non-traditional sense.)*

Tetris is one of the most famous and addictive games, but it is one that can't be won. Competition and winning are *not* defining features of games. 

[notgames.org](https://notgames.org) - "Can we create a form of digital entertainment that explicitly rejects the structure of games? ... that does not rely on competition, goals, rewards, winning or losing?"

> "a form of entertainment that really doesn't have a winner, or even a real conclusion" - Nintendo president Satoru Iwata ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-game))

Non-games have existed since the early days of video games, although there hasn't been a specific term for them. The most famous large-scale industry examples are SimCity and Second Life, but recently there has been a lot more active creativity outside the normal bounds of gaming, especially coming from the indie community, and more widely considered close to [games-as-art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_games_as_an_art_form). In the last couple of years, some have been called "walking simulators" -- although this doesn't capture the full range of experiences found, the rejection of common tropes and trend toward purposelessness is evident. 

> Now that there's so much willingness, technology and skill to create beautiful virtual worlds, it's disappointing how many videogames cling to obstacle-based designs. As if players have to earn the privilege to explore by passing an irrelevant test. Now is the time to open up this medium, to let go of our affections and addictions, of our loyalty to childhood memories, to open up the beauty of videogames for the world to see... Let design mean the building of bridges and the opening of doors, not the hiding of keys and the cowardly sniper shot. (Michael Samyn, TaleOfTales)

## Reference points:

### Proteus

<div class="youtube" data-embed="gWs_RKXkyu0"></div>

[Proteus](https://www.visitproteus.com) is an "open world exploration game". **It has no specific goals.** Every creature and plant has a unique musical signature. The game world is procedurally generated, creating a unique layout each game. Non-realistic 8-bit style. Slow-paced.

Proteus sold 23,000 copies in first nine months. It achieved 80% rating on metacritic (despite “not being a game”...)

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus_(video_game))

#### Gardenarium

<div class="youtube" data-embed="c92MWml-Gyo"></div>

### Dear Esther

<div class="youtube" data-embed="hlGdbziSwEY"></div>

Dear Esther is an experimental first-person art video game developed by The Chinese Room. The game does not follow traditional video game conventions, as it involves minimal interaction from the player and does not require choices to be made nor tasks to be completed. It instead places focus on its story, which is told through a fragmented, epistolary narrative as the player explores an unnamed island in the Hebrides.

[On Edge: A Chat With Robert Briscoe](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/10/23/on-edge-a-chat-with-robert-briscoe/#more-173753) - "One of the goals with Dear Esther's art was to make the island look like one big organic sculpture, with rocks, grass and even buildings seemingly growing from its surface... The caves are a unique break in Dear Esther's bleak, open environments that allowed room to explore a more surreal, organic style that was full of metaphors and hidden imagery... One of my pet gripes is that every game today wants to look like it's shot through Michael Bay's sunglasses or JJ Abrams' asshole"

By October 2013 Dear Esther sold over 750,000 copies.

**Everybody's Gone to the Rapture**

<div class="youtube" data-embed="4Gt_6BHhjaM"></div>

Deep within the Shropshire countryside, the village of Yaughton stands empty. Toys lie forgotten in the playground, the wind blows quarantine leaflets around the silent churchyard. Uncover the traces of the vanished community; discover fragments of events and memories to piece together the mystery of the apocalypse. 

### Flow

<div class="youtube" data-embed="9pRBptP3i1Q"></div>

In the fall of 2005, Jenova Chen and Kellee Santiago began thinking about creating their own video game company. The two were in their final year as master's students in the Interactive Media Program at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts. 

The title is taken from the eponymous psychological mental state. "In positive psychology, flow, also known as the zone, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) Mihály Csíkszentmihályi named this and identified it as a state in which the challenges posed by the environment approach a person's optimal capacity to address them. In the game Flow, one is free to descend or ascend levels of difficulty (as literal levels of depth in the water) to achieve an optimal flow state.

Chen went on to found thatgamecompany and produced works such as Flower and Journey.

**Flower**

<div class="youtube" data-embed="Nnxk-USQyfQ"></div>

In Flower, the player controls the wind, blowing a flower petal through the air using the movement of the game controller. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Flower was primarily intended to arouse positive emotions in the player, rather than to be a challenging and "fun" game. The team viewed their efforts as creating a work of art, removing gameplay elements and mechanics that were not provoking the desired response in the players. 

**Journey**

<div class="youtube" data-embed="Nnxk-USQyfQ"></div>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_KrjxD8djo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In Journey, the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air. The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game))

### The Unfinished Swan

<div class="youtube" data-embed="nhyNzFShhIc"></div>

[The Unfinished Swan](https://www.giantsparrow.com/games/swan/) is a game about exploring the unknown. The player is a young boy chasing after a swan who has wandered off into a surreal, unfinished kingdom. The game begins in a completely white space where players can throw paint to splatter their surroundings and reveal the world around them.

Ian Dallas was also a graduate student at the University of Southern California. "He worked on his idea for a game in a class and periodically went to visit a faculty member, Mark Bolas, to show prototypes. One of those days, he showed off “Whitespace,” where **the idea was to explore a 3D world that started out with a blank screen.** That became the core defining game mechanic behind The Unfinished Swan, which Dallas describes as a “first-person painting” game." [How The Unfinished Swan moved from student project to PS3 downloadable game, by Dean Takahashi](https://venturebeat.com/2013/03/25/how-the-unfinished-swan-moved-from-student-project-to-playstation-3-downloadable-game/)

> In the same article, Dallas also says: “There is a difference between knowing the tools and becoming fluent with them... You want to get under the hood and do things they were not meant to do."

The Unfinished Swan won two BAFTA awards in 2013, one for Game Innovation and one for Debut Game.

### The Stanley Parable

<div class="youtube" data-embed="gblvOhnv2k0"></div>

An interactive fiction video game designed by Davey Wreden. Originally a mod of Half Life 2, it was later rewritten with the Source engine and launched through Steam Greenlight. There are no combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the player guides Stanley, the game's protagonist, through a surreal environment while the narrator, voiced by British actor Kevan Brighting, delivers exposition. The player has the opportunity to make numerous decisions on which paths to take, and because at times the narrator says what Stanley will do next, the player can choose to ignore the narration and make a different choice. Every choice made by the player is commented on by the narrator, and depending on the choices the player makes, they will encounter different endings to the game before it restarts.

**The Beginner's Guide**

<div class="youtube" data-embed="OPP9pdApRQE"></div>

Narrated by Davey Wreden, it takes the user through a number of incomplete and abstract game creations made by a developer named Coda. Wreden challenges the player to try to come to understand the type of person Coda is from exploring these spaces in a first-person perspective. Within the narrative, the player discovers that Wreden had tried to force meaning onto Coda's games, causing them to end their relationship.

[From Tale of Tales](https://tale-of-tales.com/bientotlete/)

> Forbes - “Of course, basing a computer game set in the distant future on an examination of the quiet desperation of bourgeois French womanhood in the 1950s is, itself, going to look like non-linear art game weirdness. But there is a plan.”
