## Course Description

In this year long studio course the class collaborates on the realization of two or three ambitious game projects. Students will work together as a development team by taking on roles where they focus on specific aspects of the project (such as Director, Designer, Artist, Programmer, Level Designer, Sound Designer, Publicity, etc.) The development team structure is modeled on teams used in large-scale project development within fields related to games that rely on multi-stakeholder collaboration and interdisciplinary research. Projects may incorporate partnerships with York-based or external Faculties, Departments, or research teams depending on the focus of the project. The nature of the project themes will vary from year to year, but will be a significant work in the field of games. The details of the project(s) will be developed as part of the class activities. As part of the project development and execution students will be expected to prepare presentations, posters, and a written paper. The culmination of this course will be a final presentation in a public venue. In addition to group assignments, students are evaluated based on their individual contribution, teamwork, presentations, and other deliverables as appropriate. 

**Prerequisites:** Only open to students the Digital Media Specialized Honours BA program Games stream. FA/DATT 2300 3.0, FA/DATT 2301 3.0, LE/EECS 2030 3.0 Course credit exclusion: FA/DATT 3700 6.0

**Time:** Fall Semester: Mondays, 2pm - 5pm / Winter Semester: Mondays, 1.30pm - 4.30pm

**Location:** ACW 103

Additional resource locations:
- [The Digital Media Art & Technology Learning Lab (ATLL), Accolade West 102](https://dm.ampd.yorku.ca). To use the Digital Media Lab outside of class time, you must purchase a Digital Media Lab Card. Lab Cards are $25 for the year, or $15 for one term. The Digital Media Lab Card can be purchased in the front desk of the Computational Arts/Visual Arts and Art History office, located on the second floor of the Goldfarb Centre for Fine Arts. The office is open Monday to Friday, 8:30am-4:30pm. Once you have paid, take your receipt to Frank Tsonis in ACW 102 and he will issue you a card.
- [Alice lab, GCFA309](https://worldmaking.github.io), with VR and motion tracking systems. 
- AMPD's Motion Media Lab at [Cinespace Film Studios](https://cinespace.com), with an [Organic Motion markerless motion capture](https://www.organicmotion.com). 

## Organization of the Course 

The first part of the course focuses on ideation toward proposal development, including rapid pitching, peer reviews, thematic lectures, tutorials, individual research and experimentation, establishing groups, critique and discussion, collaborative sketching, design document development, project management, alpha development, and internal and external review. We expect to approve two or three projects for production, by groups of between three and six members each. 

The second part of the course focuses on production, culminating in public dissemination, with team members taking on specific roles and responsibilities, supported by periodic demo and test, critique/review, and specialized technical tutorials. The final game must be presented in at least one public event prior to the end of the semester. 

Beside group work, throughout the project production you will be asked to maintain a 'devblog' updated weekly, to submit a number of individual written assignments or questionnaires, and contribute generously to in-class discussions. Students must attend all class times, and should expect to spend three or more hours per week on assignments and contributions to group work outside of class time.

Throughout the course, as instructors we will act primarily in two roles. First, along with external partners, we will act as the clients, perhaps akin to publishers or curators, of the projects: we issue the call, we articulate the requirements, and will play the principal role in selecting and refining the proposals and their subsequent production. Second, we will act as pedagogical and technical support: we will lead several guided tutorial sessions in the likely software platforms for projects, followed by focused lab critique and guidance as the projects develop. We will also introduce and are happy to support mainstream gaming engines including Unreal and Unity, as well as less conventional platforms. Over the first semester we will also lead tutorials in key areas to support this year's call for work, such as Unity, VR, gamification, data analysis, machine learning, etc.


## Evaluation

The final grade for the course will be based on the following items weighted as indicated:

**Fall Semester**
- Short written assignments: 20% 
- Group proposals: 20% 
- Group prototypes & presentations: 40% 
- Role contribution: 20%

**Winter Semester**
- Role contribution: 30% 
- Reflective papers: 30% 
- Final project: 40%

**Grading**: The final grade is derived from the Fall and Winter grades. The grading scheme for the course conforms to the 9-point grading system used in undergraduate programs at York (e.g., A+ = 9, A = 8, B+ - 7, C+ = 5, etc.). Assignments and tests will bear either a letter grade designation or a corresponding number grade (e.g., A+ = 90 to 100, A = 80 to 90, B+ = 75 to 79, etc.)  For a full description of York grading system see the York University Undergraduate Calendar at [https://calendars.registrar.yorku.ca/2010-2011/academic/index.htm](https://calendars.registrar.yorku.ca/2010-2011/academic/index.htm).

**Assignment Submission:** Proper academic performance depends on students doing their work not only well, but on time. Accordingly, assignments for this course must be received on the due date specified for the assignment. ***All assignments must be submitted to complete the course.***

**Lateness Penalty:** Assignments received later than the due date will be penalized five grade points per day that assignment is late. Exceptions to the lateness penalty for valid reasons such as illness, compassionate grounds, etc., may be entertained by the Course Instructor but will require supporting documentation (e.g., a doctor’s letter).

## 2018-2019: Making games for health, disability and inclusivity

We seek proposals for three new works in the area of video games, to be developed to a fully-realized play-tested state suitable for its presentation in a public venue, and dissemination online.

In this year's course the call for work is rooted in a theme of using game design & mechanics toward mental and physiological health/wellbeing, paired with contemporary digital technologies that may include data science, machine learning, and VR. You will be asked to create a game/an app/a gamification project/a game controller, which will be designed specifically to meet specific needs of players with disabilities, health issues, or mental health issues. For example:

- A game controller design for players with hearing issues
- A VR game designed for people suffering from mobility issues

This year we are fortunate to have at least one, and possibly several external partners working with us (TBC). Therefore there may be one or more versions of this call with more specific expectations and requirements, but still fitting with the overall theme:

### Ocutherapy.com

This year we are very fortunate to have with us Alex Theodorou, managing director of  [Ocutherapy.com](http://ocutherapy.com):

> [Ocutherapy](http://ocutherapy.com) offers virtual reality guided rehabilitation - made easy. Being user centered, accessible, and targeted, Ocutherapy focuses on brain injury effects by offering interactive therapeutic tasks and being available to those who need it most.   
Ocutherapy is simple to use; offering clearly illustrated and guided experiences making rehabilitation always within arms-reach.   
Using dynamic gameplay, Ocutherapy adapts to the evolving needs of the user in real-time, creating a truly connected therapeutic experience.   
With each use, Ocutherapy learns to identify and better assist users by simply interacting with their environment, bridging the gap between game and therapy.

In this collaboration are looking for a team to work creatively in game design and development toward the gamification of tasks that relate to solving a problem one would encounter in everyday life with full integrated system of rewards, accomplishments, and goals using virtual reality technology. The ideal program will consist of game mechanics, immersion, and usability with a focus on accessibility. 

The goal is to create an interactive task that gamifies a cognitive exercise for traumatic brain injury. Exercises include paper-based assessments to examine areas of memory, attention, spatial orientation, balance, proprioception....etc

The project will involve a range of activities from visual assets and environment design to VR functionality and back-end programming, and will focus on the Unity game engine targeting VR headsets such as the Oculus Go. Being able to implement user centred design, using non-conventional gaming controllers (hands, gestures...etc), speech (chat-activated features to enhance ease of use) are just some methods to interact with the virtual environment.

Key deliverables:

-       Translating these tasks into fun and engaging applications
-       Connecting real world situations to interactive gameplay
-       Optimize application performance for hardware configurations
-       Focusing on user inclusive gameplay for cognitive impairments as seen in traumatic brain injury
-       Dynamic difficulty threshold of tasks
-       Creating narrative-guided gameplay is a bonus


### Rationale: gamification for health and wellbeing

Gamification involves applying game design techniques, game mechanics, and/or game style to non-game applications to solve problems and engage audiences. Game play focuses and controls our attention, taps into our innate strengths, thrills us utterly, and compels us to greater resilience in the attainment of more powerful and effective skills. That’s why many believe it is perfect for behavior change in healthcare. 

According to a Markets and Markets report, the gamification industry will grow to $5.5 billion by 2018, from $421 million in 2013 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67.1%.

[The Medical Futurist, July 2017: 15 example areas for gamification in healthcare](https://medicalfuturist.com/top-examples-of-gamification-in-healthcare).

**Johnson, Daniel, et al. ["Gamification for health and wellbeing: A systematic review of the literature."](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782916300380) Internet Interventions 6 (2016): 89-106:**

> "The current state of evidence supports that gamification can have a positive impact in health and wellbeing, particularly for health behaviours."

- The major health challenges facing are shifting from pre-modern risks like malnutrition, poor water quality, to challenges generated by the modern world itself. Today, the **leading global risks for mortality and chronic diseases are linked to people's individual health behaviours** in a modern lifestyle characterized by sedentary living, chronic stress, and high intake of energy-dense foods and recreational drugs. 
- **Behaviour change** (physical activity, diet, preventive and rehabilitative exercises etc.) has become one of the most important and frequently targeted levers for reducing the burden of preventable disease and death and increasing well-being.
- **Individual motivation** is one of the main factors driving behaviour change.
- **Extrinsically motivated** activity is for an outcome separable from the activity itself, like rewards or punishments, which thwarts autonomy need satisfaction and gives rise to experiences of unwillingness, tension, and coercion... 
- **Intrinsic motivation**: activities done ‘for their own sake,’ which satisfy basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, giving rise to the experience of volition, willingness, and enjoyment. Intrinsically motivated behaviour change is more sustainable than extrinsically motivated change, and also **directly contributes to mental and social well-being**.

> "In short, in our modern life world, health and well-being strongly depend on the individual's health behaviours, motivation is a major factor of health behaviour change, and intrinsically motivated behaviour change is desirable as it is both sustained and directly contributes to well-being. 

> "...**A main rationale for using games for serious purposes like health is their ability to motivate**: Games are systems purpose-built for enjoyment and engagement."

- There has been a rapid ascent of digital technology for health behaviour & well-being, including consumer applications & hardware for self-monitoring (“quantified self” or “personal informatics”). Serious games for health, games used to drive health-related outcomes, are an important sector of this. The majority are “health behaviour change games” or “health games” affecting the health behaviours of health care receivers, targetting areas such as:
	- “exergames” or “active video games” directly requiring physical activity as input, 
	- behavioural games focusing specific behaviours, 
	- rehabilitation games guiding rehabilitative movements, 
	- educational games targeting belief and attitude change as a precondition to behaviour change.

** Jane McGonigal. [Reality is Broken, 2001](http://janemcgonigal.com/my-book/), 2001.**

- culture around games is shifting, as it grows rapidly
- "game" and "player" are currently culturally pejorative terms
	- reflect fear of losing track of where game ends and reality begins
- suggests that we wish to spend so much time in games because "reality is broken"
- but to understand why, what is a game?

Jane McGonigal identifies within the vast diversity of games (both within & beyond the digital forms) feature four defining traits. Everything else McGonigal holds are there to enhance these four traits:

- **goal(s)**: outcomes to achieve, focusing attention and orienting partipation. *Purpose*. 
- **rules**: limitations on how goals can be achieved. "Rules push players to explore previously uncharted possibility spaces. They unleash creativity and foster strategic thinking."
- **feedback system**: Tells players how close they are to achieving goals. Points, levels, scores, progress bars, "the game is over when...", etc. A *promise* of achievability, and a *motivation* to continue playing. Variety and intensity of **feedback** is what differentiates digital and non-digital games. You can feel how attentive the game is to you, and approach the very limits of [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). 
- **voluntary participation**: All players knowingly and willingly accept the goal, rules, and feedback. A common ground for participation. Freedom to enter/leave establishes a *safe* and *pleasurable* activity. 

> Bernard Suits: **"Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles."**

- McGonigal paraphrases: *"any well-designed game is an invitation to tackle an unnecessary obstacle"*. Examples: 
	- golf: choosing to make the work of getting a ball into a hall more difficult.
	- Scrabble: "freedom to work in the most logical and efficient way is the very *opposite* of gameplay"
	- Tetris: 
		- Variety and intensity of feedback is what differentiates digital and non-digital games. You can feel how attentive the game is. Brings you to very limits of [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). 
		- Most addictive game, but you can't ever win. Competition and winning are *not* defining features of games. Related to [infinite games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games)
	- Portal: The goal in the first scene is to find out what the goal is. Common strategy today (gamers don't read manuals). In each puzzle you have to teach yourself the physics (the rules). Four traits are there, but in a different order. We are given feedback first, rather than goal + rules.

- Why do unnecessary obstacles make us happy?
	- Hard work that we choose to do (with no real danger).
		- Diversity of hard work games offer: **high-stakes work, busywork, mental work, physical work, discovery work, teamwork, creative work**.
	- The opposite of play isn't work. It's depression: pessimistic sense of inadequacy, despondent lack of activity, being forced into the wrong place
		- reversed: optimistic sense of capabilities, invigorating rush of activity. Sounds like gameplay.
		- playing activates all neurological/physiological systems of  happiness: attention systems, reward center, motivation systems, emotion & memory centers 
	- We resent hard work we don't choose to do. It stresses us, or bores us, etc. [It doesn't match us.] 	
	- Psychologists found that relaxing fun (tv, chocolate, window-shopping etc.) doesn't make us feel better; mildly depressing. *We seek passive/low-engagement experiences to counterbalance overstimulation/overwhelmedness* but we overdo it. 
		- better to seek "hard fun", *"eustress"*, in which there is no real danger or failure
		- Tal Ben-Shahar: **"we're much happier *enlivening* time rather than killing time."**
		- *Fiero*: possibly the most primal emotional rush we can experience. Italian for pride, adopted by game designers. Triumph over adversity. One of the most powerful neurochemical highs we can experience.	
	- *"A good game is a unique way of structuring experience and provoking positive emotion."* [Even horror games]

- Gamification moral: motivate hard work, inspire participation, of millions, by giving well-designed games to play instead of systems for people to "game", to make a better world.
	
Her book did indeed help launch gamification: The use of game thinking and game mechanics to engage users in solving problems. I.e. making your day job/school life like a game, manipulating your natural desires for competition, achievement, status, self-expression, altruism, and closure. It has been used for crowdsourcing (foldit, google ESP), marketing, and training. The reward is external to the gameplay (Jane McGonigal); prefer intrinsic reward of “gameful design”. 

There are also criticisms; ways it can fail -- e.g. called "exploitationware" by Ian Bogost, over-simple reward systems can stifle creativity, and encourage hurried rather than deep activity. In coming weeks we will return to this, as we look at ways of designing games for change.

Announcement: [Book launch, "Worldmaking as Techné", Weds Sep 26th @7pm, Toronto Media Arts Centre, 32 Lisgar St](http://worldmakingastechne.net)

- Task 1: prepare a 4-minute "elevator pitch"
	- An Elevator Pitch is a summary used to quickly and simply define your idea, and its *value proposition.*
	- Your pitch should be concise but compelling
	- Focus on what is **unique** about your idea, how it differentiates itself
	- Contextualize your idea with reference to other work (not necessarily games). 
	- You will only be able to use the classroom computer's web browser to support your pitch.
	- We will maintain the 5 minutes ruthlessly. You must fill all of the time, and no more. 
	- If you had several ideas or variants tell us, but first focus should be on the one you think is most interesting in how it responds to the call
	
General Questions to ask yourself:

- Can you identify a core mechanic? Can you identify some secondary mechanics?
- Can you distill your concept into one fortune-cookie length line (a tag line)? And if you can, does it still sound good?
- How will the player interact with the game? Think about the verbs of the interaction
- Where will the game be played? How will it influence the digital space?
- Does the technology you choose complement the mechanics? Is it necessary to use it? Can you use an alternative? 
- What is the theme of your game? Do the mechanics and technology complement the theme?
- What emotion/feeling do you want to invoke? How are you planning to make the player feel those emotions
- Games are based on rules. These might be embedded into systems, mechanics, physical simulations, etc., but they are still rules. Your game will have to have its core rules. **What makes a really good rule?** What makes it interesting? Why?

### Manifesto for a ludic century (Erik Zimmerman)

Erik Zimmerman's article [on Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/manifesto-the-21st-century-will-be-defined-by-games-1275355204), formed as a manifesto, argues for games as the defining medium of the current century:

> The last century's media was based on information communication: linear, often unidirectional; creating bureaucratic systems. This century's media is non-linear, systemic, modular, participatory, customizable, playful. Environmental: immersive, inhabitable, explorable. Complex systems thinking. 

> It is not enough to merely be a systems-literate person; to understand systems in an analytic sense. We also must learn to be playful in them. A playful system is a human system, a social system rife with contradictions and with possibility.

Ian Bogost's response: [Winning Isn't Everything](https://medium.com/matter/winning-isnt-everything-255b3a26d1cf):

>  "I used to think that games would be the dominant medium of the 21st century. The reality? They're too big, too complex, and too smart for that to be true."
